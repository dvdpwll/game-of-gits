House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned Stark ate a lollipop and it was good.

Then a dragon came out of nowhere and burned down everything!

That dragon's name? Albert Einstein.

And he was killed in a bloody battle at the wall... Jon Snow dies too. HAHA!
